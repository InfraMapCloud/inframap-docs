description: Frequently asked questions about InfraMap
---

## **1. Does InfraMap make any changes to my AWS resources?**

No. InfraMap is **100 percent read-only**.
We do not modify, create, or delete any resources.
We do not install agents or deploy infrastructure inside your account.

InfraMap only queries descriptive APIs to build a live map of your environment and detect drift.

---

## **2. What permissions does InfraMap require?**

InfraMap requires a **read-only IAM role** with the ability to list and describe specific AWS services. You can:

* restrict the role to specific accounts
* restrict it to specific regions
* add IAM conditions for external ID
* enable CloudTrail logging of all access

The permissions and trust policy are provided during setup.

## **3. Will connecting InfraMap to my AWS environment affect our SOC 2 certification?**

No. InfraMap connects using a **strict read-only IAM role** with the minimum set of permissions required to list resources. InfraMap does not deploy agents, modify infrastructure, or write any data to your AWS environment.

SOC 2 focuses on access controls, change management, and vendor evaluation. A read-only visibility tool aligns with those controls and does not interfere with compliance. Many SOC 2 certified companies use similar read-only integrations.

We are happy to provide the exact IAM policy and walk your security team through every permission. See [here](/getting-started/connection#step-3:-review-the-cloudformation-template) for the exact policy request template.

## **4. How often does InfraMap scan my environment?**

Scan frequency depends on your plan:

* **Free**: once every 24 hours
* **Pro**: automatic hourly scans
* **Enterprise**: configurable scan intervals

---

## **5. Does InfraMap store my AWS data?**

InfraMap stores only the metadata required to:

* build the infrastructure map
* detect drift
* track historical changes
* generate findings
* show cost insights

We do **not** store application data, secrets, credentials, logs, or PII.

You can delete your account at any time, and all related data is permanently removed.

---

## **6. Is my AWS access secure?**

Yes. InfraMap follows the principle of least privilege:

* A single read-only IAM role
* External ID support
* No long-lived access keys
* No agents or VPC deployments
* All communication encrypted in transit and at rest

You can revoke access instantly by removing the IAM role.

---

## **7. Does InfraMap support multi-region and multi-account setups?**

Yes.

InfraMap can map:

* multiple AWS accounts
* multiple regions per account
* relationships between resources across regions and networks

Pro and Enterprise plans offer expanded region and account limits.

---

## **8. What happens if I downgrade my plan?**

Downgrading affects:

* number of connected accounts
* number of allowed regions
* scan frequency

During the dowgrade process, we will walk you through selection which accounts and regions you want to keep - the rest will become inactive, but your data remains intact until you re-upgrade or manually remove a region.

---

## **11. Will InfraMap increase my AWS bill?**

InfraMap uses only AWS **Describe** and **List** API calls. These are either free or extremely low cost. Most users will not notice any AWS billing impact.

---

## **12. How do I delete my InfraMap account?**

You can delete your account from **Settings > Danger Zone**.

This permanently removes:

* your InfraMap account
* all resource data
* all drift history
* all findings
* all scans
* all organization data

You can reconnect later by signing in again.
