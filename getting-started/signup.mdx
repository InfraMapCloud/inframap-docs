# Signing Up

Getting started with InfraMap is quick and easy. Create your account to begin mapping and visualizing your cloud infrastructure.

## Authentication Methods

### Google Authentication

Currently, InfraMap supports **Google authentication** for signing up and logging in. Simply click the "Sign in with Google" button to get started.

## Privacy & Security

### No Credentials Stored

InfraMap **never stores your AWS credentials**. When you connect your AWS account, InfraMap uses a read-only cross-account IAM role that you configure in your AWS account. Your credentials remain secure in your own AWS environment.

### Account & Data Deletion

You have complete control over your data. You can **delete your account and all associated data at any time** directly from your account settings. When you delete your account:

- All your infrastructure maps are permanently removed
- All scan history and data are deleted
- Your account information is completely removed from our systems

This process is immediate and irreversible, so please ensure you want to delete your account before proceeding.
