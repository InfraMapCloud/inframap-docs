Cloud infrastructure isn't static. It evolves, grows, mutates, and when nobody's watching, **drifts**. InfraMap continuously monitors your AWS infrastructure to detect drift-any time your cloud infrastructure doesn't match what you think it looks like.

## What is Cloud Drift?

**Drift is any time your cloud infrastructure does not match what you think it looks like.**

It's when the state on AWS (or GCP, Azure, etc.) diverges from:

- Your Terraform or CloudFormation definitions
- Your architectural diagrams
- Your security assumptions
- Your team's expectations

As described in [our article on cloud drift](https://inframap.substack.com/p/what-cloud-drift-really-means), drift is the silent entropy of cloud environments. The longer it goes unnoticed, the more dangerous it becomes.

<Warning>
Drift is one of the biggest sources of wasted spend, unnecessary risk, and painful outages in modern cloud environments. Regular drift detection is essential for maintaining a secure and cost-effective infrastructure.
</Warning>

## Where Drift Comes From

Drift sneaks into your infrastructure from many sources:

### Manual Changes in the Console

Quick "temporary" changes that become permanent:

- An engineer opens a port "temporarily" for debugging
- A bucket gets a public access policy "for testing"
- An EC2 instance is resized "just for now"

These manual changes often go undocumented and unrecorded.

### Automation That Nobody Tracks

Orphaned automation continues to modify resources:

- Old CI/CD jobs that still run
- Orphaned Lambda functions
- Legacy scripts from former team members
- Scheduled tasks that modify resources

### Autoscaling and Ephemeral Resources

Dynamic infrastructure creates drift:

- Clusters scale up and down automatically
- New tasks, pods, and ENIs appear and disappear
- It becomes unclear what caused what
- Resources remain attached long after they should be removed

### Infrastructure-as-Code Drift

IaC tools and actual infrastructure diverge:

- Terraform apply fails partway through
- Someone force-removes a resource manually
- Tags get out of sync between code and reality
- Terraform thinks the world is one thing, AWS shows something else

### New Services Added Without Review

Developers spin up resources without visibility:

- DynamoDB tables created for testing
- API Gateways set up without documentation
- S3 buckets created without proper policies
- NAT Gateways and load balancers added ad-hoc

## Why Drift Is a Serious Problem

### Security Gaps

Drift is a leading cause of security vulnerabilities:

- **Public S3 buckets** - Buckets made public for testing that were never secured
- **Overly permissive security groups** - Ports opened temporarily that remain open
- **Missing encryption** - Resources created without encryption enabled
- **Forgotten IAM policies** - Policies left in place after projects end
- **Exposed APIs** - Endpoints made public during development

Attackers love drift because it creates vulnerabilities nobody is looking at.

### Cost Waste

Drift is one of the top drivers of cloud overspend:

- **Abandoned volumes** - EBS volumes detached but never deleted
- **Old NAT Gateways** - Gateways from decommissioned environments
- **Idle EC2 instances** - Instances left running after projects end
- **Unused API Gateways** - Gateways created for testing
- **Forgotten RDS instances** - Databases from old projects
- **Zombie ENIs** - Network interfaces that should be deleted
- **Stale EKS node groups** - Kubernetes resources that are no longer needed

Every company has at least some of this accidentally running right now.

### Outages Caused by Surprise Dependencies

Drift creates hidden dependencies that cause outages:

- You delete a "test" security group and production breaks
- Someone updates a Lambda layer and three services fail
- A resource appears unused but is actually critical
- Dependencies aren't documented or understood

### Terraform and IaC Failures

Drift makes Infrastructure-as-Code unmanageable:

- `terraform apply` errors due to state mismatches
- Resources that can't be destroyed because of drift
- Stale state files that don't reflect reality
- Forced imports to reconcile differences
- Scary-looking diffs that nobody wants to approve

## How InfraMap Detects Drift

InfraMap continuously monitors your infrastructure by comparing snapshots over time to detect any changes.

### Continuous Monitoring

InfraMap performs regular scans of your infrastructure:

- **Daily scans** (Free Forever plan) - Capture infrastructure state daily
- **Hourly scans** (Pro and Enterprise plans) - More frequent detection of changes
- **Automatic snapshots** - Infrastructure state is captured at each scan
- **Change comparison** - Each new snapshot is compared to previous ones

### Snapshot Comparison

InfraMap detects drift by comparing infrastructure snapshots:

1. **Baseline snapshot** - Initial capture of your infrastructure state
2. **Subsequent snapshots** - Regular captures of current state
3. **Change detection** - Comparison identifies differences
4. **Drift flagging** - Changes are flagged and categorized

### Types of Changes Detected

InfraMap flags various types of infrastructure changes:

#### Configuration Changes

- **EC2 instance upgrades** - Instance type changes, size modifications
- **Security group modifications** - Rules added, removed, or changed
- **IAM policy updates** - Permissions granted or revoked
- **Resource tagging** - Tags added, removed, or modified
- **Network configuration** - VPC, subnet, or routing changes

#### Resource Lifecycle Changes

- **New resources** - Resources created outside of IaC
- **Deleted resources** - Resources removed manually
- **Resource state changes** - Instances started, stopped, or terminated
- **Attachments and detachments** - EBS volumes, network interfaces, etc.

#### Relationship Changes

- **New connections** - Resources connected to new services
- **Broken connections** - Dependencies removed or changed
- **Orphaned resources** - Resources no longer connected to anything

### Change Notifications

When drift is detected, InfraMap provides:

- **Change summary** - What changed and when
- **Resource details** - Specific resources affected
- **Impact assessment** - Potential security, cost, or operational impact
- **Email alerts** - Notifications for significant changes (Pro and Enterprise plans)
- **Change history** - Timeline of all detected changes

<Info>
InfraMap builds a real-time visual map of your entire cloud infrastructure, highlighting configuration changes, unused resources, public exposure, security misconfigurations, and orphaned assets-the exact things that drift silently creates.
</Info>

## Viewing Drift in InfraMap

### Drift Dashboard

The drift dashboard provides:

- **Recent changes** - Latest detected changes across your infrastructure
- **Change frequency** - How often changes are occurring
- **Change by service** - Which services are changing most
- **Change by account** - Drift across multiple accounts
- **Trend analysis** - Patterns in infrastructure changes

### Resource-Level Drift

View drift for individual resources:

- **Change history** - Timeline of changes to a specific resource
- **Configuration drift** - How current config differs from expected
- **Relationship changes** - How connections have changed over time
- **State changes** - Lifecycle events and state transitions

### Infrastructure Map Integration

See drift visualized in your infrastructure maps:

- **Change indicators** - Visual markers for resources with recent changes
- **Drift overlay** - Highlight resources that have drifted
- **Relationship changes** - See how connections have evolved
- **Historical comparison** - Compare current state to previous snapshots

## Preventing Drift

While drift is inevitable in cloud environments, you can minimize its impact:

### Regular Monitoring

- **Review drift reports** - Check drift dashboard regularly
- **Set up alerts** - Get notified of significant changes
- **Investigate changes** - Understand why changes occurred
- **Document exceptions** - Record intentional changes

### Infrastructure-as-Code

- **Use IaC consistently** - Make all changes through code
- **Review IaC changes** - Use pull requests and code review
- **Reconcile drift** - Regularly sync IaC with actual state
- **Automate deployments** - Reduce manual changes

### Access Control

- **Limit console access** - Restrict who can make manual changes
- **Use IAM policies** - Enforce least privilege
- **Enable CloudTrail** - Audit all infrastructure changes
- **Require approvals** - Use change management processes

### Team Practices

- **Document changes** - Record why changes were made
- **Review architecture** - Regular reviews of infrastructure
- **Communicate changes** - Share changes with the team
- **Clean up regularly** - Remove unused resources

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Regular Drift Reviews">
Review drift reports weekly or monthly to:
- Stay aware of infrastructure changes
- Identify unauthorized modifications
- Catch configuration drift early
- Maintain infrastructure documentation
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Investigating Changes">
When drift is detected:
- Verify if the change was intentional
- Check who made the change (via CloudTrail)
- Assess security and cost impact
- Update documentation or IaC as needed
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Reconciling Drift">
To reconcile drift with IaC:
- Import drifted resources into Terraform/CloudFormation
- Update IaC definitions to match reality
- Plan and apply changes carefully
- Test changes in non-production first
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Preventing Future Drift">
To prevent drift:
- Use Infrastructure-as-Code for all changes
- Limit manual console access
- Set up automated drift detection alerts
- Regularly review and clean up resources
</Accordion>

## Why Drift Gets Worse as Companies Scale

Drift grows exponentially with:

- **Number of engineers** - More people making changes
- **Number of environments** - Dev, staging, production, etc.
- **Number of regions** - Resources spread across regions
- **Number of services** - More services to monitor
- **Number of automation pipelines** - More automated changes

The more people touch the cloud, the more unpredictable it becomes. Eventually, nobody has a single coherent view of the infrastructure. Everyone sees just their piece of the world.

**That's exactly where InfraMap comes in.**

Instead of hunting through AWS console pages, IAM policies, or Terraform diffs, InfraMap shows you:

> **"Here's what changed, here's what's risky, and here's where you're wasting money."**

No guesswork. No detective work. No drift surprises.
