# Cost Analysis

InfraMap provides comprehensive cost visibility and analysis for your AWS infrastructure. Using AWS Cost APIs, we deliver accurate cost estimates at the resource level and organization-wide, helping you understand exactly where your money is being spent and identify opportunities for optimization.

## How It Works

InfraMap integrates with **AWS Cost Explorer API** and **AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR)** to provide real-time and historical cost data. Our system:

- **Queries AWS Cost APIs** — Retrieves cost data directly from AWS
- **Estimates resource costs** — Calculates monthly cost estimates for individual resources
- **Aggregates organization costs** — Provides account-wide and organization-wide cost views
- **Tracks trends over time** — Monitors cost changes and identifies anomalies
- **Identifies waste** — Detects idle resources and optimization opportunities

<Info>
For Enterprise plans, InfraMap can ingest Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) for even more detailed and accurate cost analysis, including advanced cost allocation and custom cost views.
</Info>

## Resource-Level Cost Estimation

Every resource in InfraMap displays its estimated monthly cost. These estimates are calculated using:

- **AWS pricing data** — Current AWS pricing for each service and region
- **Resource specifications** — Instance types, storage sizes, data transfer volumes
- **Usage patterns** — Historical usage data when available
- **Cost allocation** — Pro-rated costs for resources shared across services

### Viewing Resource Costs

You can see cost information in multiple places:

- **Resource details page** — Each resource shows its estimated monthly cost
- **Resource list view** — Sort and filter resources by cost
- **Cost breakdown** — Detailed cost components (compute, storage, data transfer, etc.)

## Organization-Wide Cost Views

Get a complete picture of your AWS spending across all accounts and regions.

### Total Cost Overview

The cost dashboard provides:

- **Total monthly cost** — Current month's spending across all accounts
- **Cost by account** — Breakdown of costs per AWS account
- **Cost by region** — See which regions are driving costs
- **Cost by service** — Understand which AWS services cost the most
- **Cost trends** — Month-over-month and year-over-year comparisons

### Multi-Account Cost Aggregation

If you have multiple AWS accounts connected:

- **Account-level costs** — Individual cost breakdown for each account
- **Aggregated totals** — Combined costs across all accounts
- **Account comparison** — Compare spending between accounts
- **Organization-wide view** — Total cost for your entire AWS organization

## Cost Breakdowns

InfraMap breaks down costs in multiple dimensions to help you understand your spending:

### By Service

See exactly which AWS services are consuming your budget:

- **EC2** — Compute instance costs
- **RDS** — Database instance costs
- **S3** — Storage and data transfer costs
- **Lambda** — Function execution costs
- **Data Transfer** — Inter-region and internet data transfer
- **And more** — All AWS services with associated costs

### By Region

Understand geographic cost distribution:

- **Regional cost breakdown** — Costs per AWS region
- **Regional comparisons** — Compare costs across regions
- **Data transfer costs** — Inter-region data transfer expenses
- **Regional pricing differences** — See how region affects pricing

### By Resource Type

Analyze costs by resource category:

- **Compute resources** — EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS costs
- **Storage resources** — S3, EBS costs
- **Database resources** — RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache costs
- **Networking resources** — Data transfer, CloudFront, API Gateway costs

## Cost Trends and Anomaly Detection

Track your spending over time and identify unusual patterns.

### Cost Charts

Visualize your costs with interactive charts showing:

- **Daily costs** — Day-by-day spending trends
- **Monthly costs** — Month-over-month comparisons
- **Yearly trends** — Long-term cost patterns
- **Forecasting** — Projected future costs based on trends

### Anomaly Detection

InfraMap automatically detects cost anomalies:

- **Sudden cost spikes** — Alerts when costs increase unexpectedly
- **Unusual patterns** — Identifies deviations from normal spending
- **Cost alerts** — Email notifications for significant cost changes (Pro and Enterprise plans)
- **Anomaly explanations** — Insights into what caused the anomaly

<Warning>
Cost anomalies can indicate security issues (unauthorized usage), misconfigurations, or unexpected resource scaling. Review anomalies promptly to identify the cause.
</Warning>

## Cost Optimization

InfraMap helps you identify opportunities to reduce costs:

### Idle Resource Detection

Automatically identifies resources that appear unused:

- **Idle EC2 instances** — Instances with low CPU utilization
- **Unattached EBS volumes** — Volumes not attached to any instance
- **Unused S3 buckets** — Buckets with no recent access
- **Orphaned resources** — Resources no longer in use

### Rightsizing Recommendations

Get suggestions for optimizing resource sizes:

- **Over-provisioned instances** — Instances that could be downsized
- **Under-utilized resources** — Resources that could be consolidated
- **Estimated savings** — Potential monthly savings from optimization
- **Action items** — Specific recommendations to implement

### Cost Allocation Tags

Use AWS tags to track costs by:

- **Project or department** — Allocate costs to teams
- **Environment** — Separate dev, staging, and production costs
- **Application** — Track costs per application
- **Custom tags** — Any tag-based cost allocation

## Cost Reporting

Generate and export cost reports for analysis and budgeting:

### Available Reports

- **Monthly cost summary** — Overview of monthly spending
- **Service cost breakdown** — Detailed costs by AWS service
- **Regional cost analysis** — Costs by AWS region
- **Resource cost report** — Individual resource costs
- **Trend analysis** — Historical cost trends

### Export Options

- **CSV export** — Download cost data for spreadsheet analysis
- **PDF reports** — Formatted reports for sharing
- **Scheduled reports** — Automated cost reports (Enterprise plans)

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Regular Cost Reviews">
Review your costs regularly to:
- Identify unexpected cost increases early
- Track cost trends over time
