InfraMap provides comprehensive cost visibility and analysis for your AWS infrastructure. Using AWS Cost APIs, we deliver accurate cost estimates at the resource level and organization-wide, helping you understand exactly where your money is being spent and identify opportunities for optimization.

## How It Works

InfraMap integrates with **AWS Cost Explorer API** and **AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR)** to provide real-time and historical cost data. Our system:

- **Queries AWS Cost APIs** - Retrieves cost data directly from AWS
- **Estimates resource costs** - Calculates monthly cost estimates for individual resources
- **Aggregates organization costs** - Provides account-wide and organization-wide cost views
- **Tracks trends over time** - Monitors cost changes and identifies anomalies
- **Identifies waste** - Detects idle resources and optimization opportunities

<Info>
For Enterprise plans, InfraMap can ingest Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) for even more detailed and accurate cost analysis, including advanced cost allocation and custom cost views.

## Resource-Level Cost Estimation

Every resource in InfraMap displays its estimated monthly cost. These estimates are calculated using:

- **AWS pricing data** - Current AWS pricing for each service and region
- **Resource specifications** - Instance types, storage sizes, data transfer volumes
- **Usage patterns** - Historical usage data when available
- **Cost allocation** - Pro-rated costs for resources shared across services

### Viewing Resource Costs

You can see cost information in multiple places:

- **Resource details page** - Each resource shows its estimated monthly cost
- **Resource list view** - Sort and filter resources by cost
- **Cost breakdown** - Detailed cost components (compute, storage, data transfer, etc.)

## Organization-Wide Cost Views

Get a complete picture of your AWS spending across all accounts and regions.

### Total Cost Overview

The cost dashboard provides:

- **Total monthly cost** - Current month's spending across all accounts
- **Cost by account** - Breakdown of costs per AWS account
- **Cost by region** - See which regions are driving costs
- **Cost by service** - Understand which AWS services cost the most
- **Cost trends** - Month-over-month and year-over-year comparisons

### Multi-Account Cost Aggregation

If you have multiple AWS accounts connected:

- **Account-level costs** - Individual cost breakdown for each account
- **Aggregated totals** - Combined costs across all accounts
- **Account comparison** - Compare spending between accounts
- **Organization-wide view** - Total cost for your entire AWS organization
- **Cross-Provider costs** - Coming soon, multi-cloud cost aggregation across different providers

## Cost Breakdowns

InfraMap breaks down costs in multiple dimensions to help you understand your spending:

### By Service

See exactly which AWS services are consuming your budget:

- **EC2** - Compute instance costs
- **RDS** - Database instance costs
- **S3** - Storage and data transfer costs
- **Lambda** - Function execution costs
- **Data Transfer** - Inter-region and internet data transfer
- **And more** - All AWS services with associated costs

### By Region

Understand geographic cost distribution:

- **Regional cost breakdown** - Costs per AWS region
- **Regional comparisons** - Compare costs across regions
- **Data transfer costs** - Inter-region data transfer expenses
- **Regional pricing differences** - See how region affects pricing

### By Resource Type

Analyze costs by resource category:

- **Compute resources** - EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS costs
- **Storage resources** - S3, EBS costs
- **Database resources** - RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache costs
- **Networking resources** - Data transfer, CloudFront, API Gateway costs

## Cost Trends and Anomaly Detection

Track your spending over time and identify unusual patterns.

### Cost Charts

Visualize your costs with interactive charts showing:

- **Daily costs** - Day-by-day spending trends
- **Monthly costs** - Month-over-month comparisons
- **Yearly trends** - Long-term cost patterns
- **Forecasting** - Projected future costs based on trends

### Anomaly Detection

InfraMap automatically detects cost anomalies:

- **Sudden cost spikes** - Alerts when costs increase unexpectedly
- **Unusual patterns** - Identifies deviations from normal spending
- **Cost alerts** - Email notifications for significant cost changes (Pro and Enterprise plans)
- **Anomaly explanations** - Insights into what caused the anomaly

<Warning>
Cost anomalies can indicate security issues (unauthorized usage), misconfigurations, or unexpected resource scaling. Review anomalies promptly to identify the cause.
</Warning>

## Cost Optimization

InfraMap helps you identify opportunities to reduce costs:

### Idle Resource Detection

Automatically identifies resources that appear unused:

- **Idle EC2 instances** - Instances with low CPU utilization
- **Unattached EBS volumes** - Volumes not attached to any instance
- **Unused S3 buckets** - Buckets with no recent access
- **Orphaned resources** - Resources no longer in use

### Rightsizing Recommendations

Get suggestions for optimizing resource sizes:

- **Over-provisioned instances** - Instances that could be downsized
- **Under-utilized resources** - Resources that could be consolidated
- **Estimated savings** - Potential monthly savings from optimization
- **Action items** - Specific recommendations to implement
