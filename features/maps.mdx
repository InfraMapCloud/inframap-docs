InfraMap provides interactive, visual maps of your entire AWS infrastructure, giving you a bird's eye view of your organization's cloud environment. Navigate seamlessly from high-level organization views down to individual resources, understanding relationships and dependencies at every level.

## Overview

Infrastructure maps visualize your AWS resources as an interactive graph, showing:

- **Resource relationships** - How resources connect and depend on each other
- **Hierarchical organization** - Accounts, regions, VPCs, and resource groups
- **Resource details** - Zoom in to see individual resources and their configurations
- **Multi-dimensional views** - Organize by account, region, service, or custom groupings

<Info>
Maps are automatically generated and updated based on your infrastructure scans. Changes in your AWS environment are reflected in the maps as scans complete.

## Multi-Account and Multi-Region Views

### Organization-Wide View

Start with a high-level view of your entire AWS organization:

- **All accounts** - See every AWS account connected to InfraMap
- **Account relationships** - Visualize how accounts are organized
- **Cross-account dependencies** - Identify resources that span multiple accounts
- **Aggregate metrics** - Total resources, costs, and security findings across all accounts

### Account-Level View

Zoom into a specific AWS account to see:

- **All regions** - Every AWS region where resources are deployed
- **Regional distribution** - Visual representation of where resources are located
- **Account-specific resources** - All resources within that account
- **Account metrics** - Cost, security, and resource counts for the account

### Region-Level View

Focus on a specific AWS region to explore:

- **VPCs and networking** - All Virtual Private Clouds in the region
- **Regional resources** - Resources deployed in that region
- **Regional relationships** - How resources connect within the region
- **Cross-region connections** - Resources that connect to other regions

## Hierarchical Navigation

InfraMap's maps support hierarchical navigation, allowing you to drill down from high-level views to specific resources.

### Zoom and Expand

Navigate through different levels of detail:

1. **Organization level** - View all accounts
2. **Account level** - Expand to see all regions in an account
3. **Region level** - Expand to see all VPCs and resource groups
4. **VPC level** - Expand to see resources within a VPC
5. **Resource group level** - Expand to see individual resources
6. **Resource level** - View individual resource details and relationships

### Resource Groups

Organize and view resources by:

- **Service type** - Group by EC2, RDS, Lambda, S3, etc.
- **VPC** - Resources within specific Virtual Private Clouds
- **Tags** - Custom groupings based on AWS tags
- **Security groups** - Resources sharing security configurations
- **Application** - Resources belonging to the same application

## Resource Relationships

<img src="/assets/images/map_ec2.jpeg" />

One of the most powerful features of infrastructure maps is visualizing relationships between resources.

### Connection Visualization

See how resources connect to each other:

- **Network connections** - Security groups, subnets, and VPC relationships
- **Service dependencies** - Which services depend on which resources
- **Data flows** - How data moves between resources
- **Attachment relationships** - Direct attachments like EBS volumes to EC2 instances

### Example Relationships

**Lambda Functions:**
- See which **API Gateways** are attached to Lambda functions
- View **Event sources** like SQS queues or SNS topics
- Identify **IAM roles** and **VPC configurations** used by functions
- Track **CloudWatch Logs** and **X-Ray traces** associated with functions

**EC2 Instances:**
- See which **EBS volumes** are attached to each instance
- View **Security Groups** and **Network Interfaces**
- Identify **Load Balancers** that route traffic to instances
- Track **Auto Scaling Groups** and **Launch Templates**

**RDS Databases:**
- View **Subnet Groups** and **Security Groups** protecting databases
- See **Read Replicas** and their relationships
- Identify **Parameter Groups** and **Option Groups**
- Track **Backup configurations** and **Snapshots**

**S3 Buckets:**
- See **CloudFront Distributions** using buckets as origins
- View **Lambda functions** triggered by bucket events
- Identify **IAM policies** and **Bucket Policies** controlling access
- Track **Versioning** and **Replication** configurations

### Interactive Exploration

- **Click to expand** - Click on any resource or group to see its relationships
- **Hover for details** - Hover over resources to see quick information
- **Filter by relationship** - Show only resources connected to a specific resource
- **Follow connections** - Navigate along relationship paths
- **Highlight dependencies** - Highlight all resources that depend on a selected resource

## Use Cases

### Infrastructure Discovery

- **Understand your infrastructure** - Get a complete picture of your AWS environment
- **Find orphaned resources** - Identify resources that aren't connected to anything
- **Discover dependencies** - Understand what depends on critical resources
- **Document architecture** - Use maps as documentation for your infrastructure

### Troubleshooting

- **Trace connections** - Follow relationships to find the source of issues
- **Identify bottlenecks** - See where resources are concentrated
- **Find misconfigurations** - Spot resources with unusual connection patterns
- **Understand impact** - See what would be affected by changes

### Cost Optimization

- **Identify expensive regions** - See where costs are concentrated
- **Find unused resources** - Spot resources with no connections
- **Optimize data transfer** - See cross-region and cross-account data flows
- **Right-size resources** - Understand resource relationships before resizing

### Security Analysis

- **Review network security** - See security group relationships
- **Identify exposed resources** - Find resources with public access
- **Track IAM usage** - See which resources use which IAM roles
- **Audit configurations** - Verify security settings across resources
