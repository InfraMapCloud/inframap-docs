# Welcome to InfraMap

InfraMap is a real-time, interactive visualization tool that provides comprehensive visibility into your cloud infrastructure. By continuously discovering and mapping AWS resources across all accounts and regions, InfraMap enables you to instantly identify waste, drift, and potential risks in your cloud environment.

## What is InfraMap?

InfraMap visualizes your AWS infrastructure as an interactive map, showing live relationships between services like EC2, RDS, ECS, VPCs, Lambda, S3, and more. It connects through a **read-only cross-account IAM role** and builds a live graph of every resource and its relationships, giving you instant context to your entire cloud environment.
